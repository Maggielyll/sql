**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my experience as an accountant, where I was often involved with data-related tasks, I’ve come to see the importance of integrating ethics and equity into my approach to data handling. While not a data analyst by trade, I’ve managed key responsibilities such as preparing reports on fund performance and conducting ESG data analysis, where data integrity and fairness were essential.

One example was during my time at Apex Fund Services, where I supervised a team handling ESG data as part of a multi-million-dollar company acquisition. Ensuring the accuracy of ESG metrics required us to go beyond surface-level data analysis to understand how the company’s practices impacted not only its financial performance but also its social responsibilities. I focused on making sure the data reflected these broader effects, avoiding cherry-picking favorable metrics that might skew the results.

Another instance occurred at CIBC Mellon, where I prepared daily reports monitoring market volatility and investor allocations. While efficiency was important, I made it a point to ensure that the data inputs were representative and free from any biases that could mislead stakeholders. In these tasks, I learned to be cautious about interpreting data without context, understanding that certain trends could disproportionately affect some clients more than others.

Moving forward, I would continue to integrate ethical scrutiny and equity considerations into my data-related duties, ensuring that the insights I generate are not only accurate but also reflect a fair and comprehensive view of the impact on all stakeholders.
